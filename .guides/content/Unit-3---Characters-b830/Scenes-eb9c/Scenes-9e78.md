## What is the difference between the stage and sprites?

In this activity, you will create a project that experiments with backdrops, like a story with multiple scenes or a slideshow.

## Start Here

1. choose from the library, paint, or upload multiple backdrops into your project.
2. Experiment with blocks from the **Looks** and **Events** categories to initiate switching backdrops

3. Add scripts to the stage and sprites to coordinate what happens when the backdrop changes in your project!

## Things to Try

Look for blocks under the sprites and the stage related to the backdrop and test them out to see what they do!
