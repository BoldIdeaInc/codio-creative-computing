## Do you want to create your own scratch blocks?

Experiment with the Make a Block feature in Scratch! In this project, you will create your own blocks that define two behaviors for two different characters.

## Start Here

1. Choose from the library, paint, or upload two sprite characters.
2. Click on the "Make a Block" button in the "My Blocks" category to create and name your block.
3. Add blocks under the **Define** block to control what your custom block will do.

5. Repeat!

Sometimes there can be more than one way of defining the same behavior. Experiment with different block combinations to try out multiple options and outcomes.
