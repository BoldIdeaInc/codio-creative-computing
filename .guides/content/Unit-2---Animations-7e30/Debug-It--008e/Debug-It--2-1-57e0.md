# This program is broken!
In this project, Scratch Cat wants to show you a dance. When you click on him, he should do a dance while a drum beat plays along with him. However, as soon as he starts to dance he stops but the drumming continues without him! 

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

{Start Over | reset}()

# Need a hint?
The "dance" effect is created by switching the sprite's costume, and repeating that action over and over. Can you think of one simple change you can make that will cause the costume to be switched repeatedly?
