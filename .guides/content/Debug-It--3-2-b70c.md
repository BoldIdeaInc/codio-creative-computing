# This program is broken!
In this project, the Scratch Cat is supposed to count from 1 to the number the user provides. But the Scratch Cat always counts to 10.

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

# Need a hint?
The **define** block defines a custom block called `counting` which has a **parameter** called `x`:

When the `counting` block is called, we pass it the `answer`, which is whatever you typed into the box when the Scratch cat asks what number to count to.

When the `counting` block runs, the `x` parameter will be equal to `answer`. 

You can drag that parameter and use it as a **variable**. Where might you use the `x` variable in the block definition?
