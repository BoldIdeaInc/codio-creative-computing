# This program is broken!
When the green ﬂag is clicked, both Gobo and Scratch Cat should start dancing. But only Scratch Cat starts Dancing!

**How do we ﬁx the program?**

# Need a hint?
Below the stage is a list of sprites in your project, along with some settings. If you click on the "Gobo" sprite, you can see the code for that sprite.

We know we want Gobo to do the same thing as Scratch Cat. Can you tell what's different between both sprites?
