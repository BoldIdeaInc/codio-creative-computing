On the left side of the screen, you'll see the **Scratch interface**. 

If your screen is small, you might have trouble seeing the whole interface.

## Give yourself some space
There are two ways you can give yourself more space to work in scratch:

### Shrink the guide panel
You can click-and-drag the line between the scratch interface and the guide. Drag it to the right to make the guide smaller and the scratch interface bigger:

### Collapse the guide
You can also "collapse" the guide to hide it altogether. This is useful when your screen is really small.

- To hide the guide, click the "Collapse" button at the top
- To show the guide again, click the ![uncollapse icon](.guides/img/uncollapse-icon.png) icon on the far right
