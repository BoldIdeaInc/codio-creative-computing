## Create your first scratch project!

In this activity, you will follow some basic steps to create a project in Scratch. Once you have completed the steps, experiment by adding other Scratch blocks to make the project your own.

## Steps

1. On the left side of the screen, you should see a list of categories, such as "Motion", "Looks", and "Sounds". Click on each one to see the different blocks inside.

2. Select the "Motion" category, then drag out the "move 10 steps" block onto the middle part of the screen. You can then click the block to see what it does.

3. Select the "Sounds" category, then drag out the "play sound Meow until done" block. Place the block right under the first one to make the "snap" together. 
   Notice how clicking the block now makes both blocks run at the same time!

4. Now we want to make it so both of these blocks run when we press the green flag. Select the "events" category, and pull out the "When (flag) clicked" block. Put it on top of the other two blocks, again making sure they "snap" together.

5. Press the green flag button to run your code. You should see the cat move right and hear a "meow" sound!
6. Try adding more blocks. Experiment to make it your own!
