# This program is broken!
The Scratch Cat should do a ﬂip when the space key is pressed. But when the space key is pressed, nothing happens!

**How do we fix the program?**

# Need a hint?

The blocks rotate the cat 90° at a time. However, each block runs at the exact same time, so you can't see it. How can you make it "pause" between each step, so that we can see it?
