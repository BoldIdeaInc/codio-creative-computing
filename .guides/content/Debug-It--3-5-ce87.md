# This program is broken!

In this project, the scene changes when you press the right arrow key. The star of the project -- a dinosaur -- should be hidden in every scene except when the scene transitions to the auditorium backdrop. In the auditorium, the dinosaur should appear and do a dance. But the dinosaur is always present and is not dancing at the right time.

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

# Need a hint?
You can use the **hide** and **show** blocks to control when the dinosaur appears or disappears. Where is the best place for those blocks?
