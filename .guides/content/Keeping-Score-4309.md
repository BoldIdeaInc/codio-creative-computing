## How can you keep score in a Scratch project?

Fish Chomp is a game where players try to catch as many Ô¨Åsh as they can by guiding a sprite with the mouse. In this activity, you will remix Fish Chomp by adding a score with **variables**.

## Start Here

1. Try playing the Fish Chomp game on the left to see how it works (click the green flag to start).
2. Click on the Make a Variable button in the Data category to create and name a variable for score.
