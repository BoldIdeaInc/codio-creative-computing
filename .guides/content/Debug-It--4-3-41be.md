# This program is broken!
In this project, Scratch Cat is thinking of a number between 1 and 10. But something is wrong with the guess checking -- it doesn't work consistently.

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

{Start Over | reset}()

# Need a hint?
1. Click the checkbox next to the `secretNumber` variable in the block pallette to show what the cat is guessing (so you can test). 
2. Test each of the following cases:
   - Guess a number **greater than** the secret number
   - Guess a number **less than** the secret number
   - Guess a number **equal to** than the secret number
3. There should be an "if" block for each of the three cases.
   For the "if equals" condition, move the "success" block inside that.
