# This program is broken!
In this project, the Happy Birthday song starts playing when the green flag is clicked. Once the song finishes, instructions should appear telling us to "click on me to blow out the candles!" But something is not working! 

The instructions to blow out the candles are shown *while* the birthday song is playing. The instructions should only appear when the song has *finished* playing.

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

{Start Over | reset}()

# Need a hint?

When you use the "play sound" block, it will start playing the sound, but it will immediately move on to the other blocks while the sound is still playing. Is there another "play sound" block you can use?
