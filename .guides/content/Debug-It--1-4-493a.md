# This program is broken!
In this project, when the green ﬂag is clicked, the Scratch Cat should saw ‘Meow, meow, meow!’ in a speech bubble and as a sound. But the speech bubble happens before the sound – and the Scratch Cat only makes one ‘Meow’ sound! How do we ﬁx the program?

# Need a hint?

- The "meow" sound needs to happen 3 times. Have you noticed the "repeat 3 times" block is missing a block inside it?
- The "Say 'meow, meow, meow' for 2 seconds" block will wait 2 seconds after showing the speech bubble. Is there another block you could use instead?
