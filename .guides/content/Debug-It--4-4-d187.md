# This program is broken!
In this project, the "# of hits" display should increase by 1 every time the Scratch Cat is hit by a tennis ball. But the "# of hits" increases by more than 1 when Scratch Cat is hit.

**How do we ﬁx the program?**

{Start Over | reset}()

# Need a hint?
Look at the code for the tennis ball. Then, look at the "if" block. This is in a "forever" loop, so it gets run over and over again. 

That means the "if touching cat -> increase hits by 1" blocks are run over and over while the ball is touching the cat.

Is there a block you can add that will wait until the ball is NOT touching the cat before it continues with the loop?
