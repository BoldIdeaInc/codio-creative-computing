# This program is broken!
In this project, Scratch Cat is navigating a maze to get to the yellow rectangle. But Scratch Cat can walk through walls.

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

{Start Over | reset}()

# Need a hint?
If the cat is touching the green color, we need to move the cat `-10` steps.

- What block can you use to check **if** the cat is touching green?
- What block can you use to make it check over-and-over again forever?
