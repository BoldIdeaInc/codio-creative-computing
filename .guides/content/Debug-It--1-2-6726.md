# This program is broken!
In this project, when the green ﬂag is clicked, the Scratch Cat should start on the left side of the stage, say something about being on the left side, glide to the right side of the stage, and say something about being on the right side. It works the ﬁrst time the green ﬂag is clicked, but not again.

**How do we ﬁx the program?**

# Need a hint?

The cat needs to start in the same position on the left side of the screen whenever the flag is clicked. What block can you use to set the position?
