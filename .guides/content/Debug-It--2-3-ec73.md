# This program is broken!
This project is programmed to draw a happy face but something is not quite right! The pen continues to draw from one of the eyes to the smile when it should not be doing so.

**How do we Ô¨Åx the program?**

{Start Over | reset}()

# Need a hint?
In your blocks pallet, click on the "Pen" category.

The **pen** has two modes. The "Pen up" block will lift the pen up, so it will not draw anything when it moves. The "Pen down" block will cause the pen to draw.

First, you'll need to figure out which part of the code draws the eyes, and which part draws the mouth. At what point in the code should the pen be lifting up/down?
